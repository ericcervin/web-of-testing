"# web-of-testing" 

Tests to monitor/compare my websites.

functional_tests_selenium.py - tests written with unittest and selenium
functional_tests_requests.py - tests written with unittest, Beautiful Soup, and requests

functional_tests_requests.py runs much faster (~10 secs vs. ~8 minutes) so it is the one that I currently update and use.
